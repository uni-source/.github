# UniSource - University-Driven Open Source Community

## Overview

UniSource is a platform developed by students from the Faculty of Technology at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura as part of our ICT project (IT3081 â€“ ICT Project). It aims to bridge the gap between university students and the software industry by facilitating student contributions to open-source projects managed by industry organizations. By participating in real-world projects, students gain practical experience, enhance their technical skills, and establish connections with industry professionals.

## Global Architecture Diagram

UniSource adopts a microservice architecture for backend scalability and flexibility. The frontend is designed using React.js for component-based UI development, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience. The client-server architecture facilitates communication via RESTful APIs, maintaining separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.
